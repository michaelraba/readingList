# Reading List for numerics 
## Why a READING LIST is necessary?

As engineers/scientific workers, we accumlate useful reference books which is quickly lost. In order to keep things more orderly as a Msc student, I've been using a [Hobonichi Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/) to keep track of research progress, and useful references frequently became lost as marginalia. With accumulating books I've found useful, I'm finding that necessary to create an orderly List of sorts, and perhaps others can find that useful.
