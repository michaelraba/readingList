# Reading List for numerics 
## Why a READING LIST is necessary?

As engineers/scientific workers, we accumlate reference books which one are are gems, but the next week are lost to memory. In order to keep things more orderly as a Msc student, I've been using a [Hobonichi Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/) to keep track of research progress, and my marginalia of my finds accumlate and become unweidy. Therefore, create an orderly List of sorts!
